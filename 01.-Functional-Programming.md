##Imperative Javascript

**Imperative style** is code that's read from top to bottom, for the most part. It tells the computer step by step exactly what to do next, and each step depends on knowing exactly where you are in the process. Statements change the state of the application as they're executed, so depending on what you did before, the code you've written may do something completely different this time. 

Suppose we have a button with a click event. When it fires, we are asked for a string. All the words in that string will be capitalized and then shown to us.

```js
var result;
function getText() {
  var someText = prompt("Give me something to capitalize");
  capWords(someText);
  alert(result.join(" "));
};
function capWords(input) {
  var counter;
  var inputArray = input.split(" ");
  var transformed = "";
  result = [];
  for (counter = 0; counter < inputArray.length; counter++) {
    transformed = [
      inputArray[counter].charAt(0).toUpperCase(),
      inputArray[counter].substring(1)
    ].join("");
    result.push(transformed);
  }
};
document.getElementById("main_button").onclick = getText;
```

##Object Oriented Javascript

**Object Oriented Style** allows the data to be treated as objects to be passed around the code. And you use defined methods to manipulate those objects. Each of those objects can have its own methods and the instances of those objects can also have methods. Messages can be passed around from one object to another and properties of objects can be hidden or shared, allowing for better encapsulation and more security in your code.

Object oriented programming also offers the opportunity to build up new functionality by adding to the abilities of an object through composition. As well as, building up new objects by inheriting properties and capabilities and enhancing them or modifying them.

```js
(function() {
  "use strict";
  var SomeText = function(text) {
    this.text = text;
    };

  SomeText.prototype.capify = function(str) {
    var firstLetter = str.charAt(0);
    var remainder = str.substring(1);
    return [firstLetter.toUpperCase(), remainder].join("");
  };
  SomeText.prototype.capifyWords = function() {
    var result = [];
    var textArray = this.text.split(" ");
    for (var counter = 0; counter < textArray.length; counter++) {
      result.push(this.capify(textArray[counter]));
    }
    return result.join(" ");
};
}());

document.getElementById("main_button").addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  var something = prompt("Give me something to capitalize");
  var newText = new SomeText(something);
  alert(newText.capifyWords());
});
```

##Functional Style

So what is functional style anyway? First of all, functional style takes advantage of the fact that JavaScript allows you to use functions as first-class objects. Which means that you can use them as arguments and you can pass them around from function to function, just as you can any other variable. Functional style also encourages you not to make changes to values that are outside of your functions or change the state of the application while you're executing the function.

Ideally, with a functional solution, what you're going to describe is the problem or the solution, not the step by step way of getting that problem solved.

**ES5**

```js
(function() {
  "use strict";
  var capify = function(str) {
    return [str.charAt(0).toUpperCase(), str.substring(1)].join("");
  };
  var processWords = function(fn, str) {
    return str.split(" ").map(fn).join(" ");
  };
  var getValue = function(e) {
    var something = prompt("Give me something to capitalize");
    alert(processWords(capify, something));
  };
  document.getElementById("main_button").addEventListener("click", getValue);
}());
```

**ES6**

```js
{
  "use strict";
  const capify = str => [str.charAt(0).toUpperCase(), str.substring(1)].join("");
  const processWords = (fn, str) => str.split(" ").map(fn).join(" ");
  const getValue = () => {
    let something = prompt("Give me something to capitalize");
    alert(processWords(capify, something));
  }
  document.getElementById("main_button").addEventListener("click", getValue);
}
```

The `{ }` is a block that, when encountered, will immediately execute just like an immediately invoked function expression.


##Pure functions

Pure functions don't rely on the state of the code that they're called from. Whatever's happening outside of them as long as you call up your function with the same values, it will always return the same results. Pure functions also don't create side effects that alter variables outside of themselves. So once you're done calling a pure function and its returned a value, nothing outside of that function has been changed, other than what happened inside of the function itself. The value that it returned is the only thing that it alters. There's only one result provided by any set of arguments that you give to a pure function. As long as you give a pure function the exact same set of arguments, it should always return the exact same results. This makes for fantastic ease of testing as well as convenience in conceiving how these functions work.

**impure function**

```js
const external = [1, 2, 3];
const impure = value => {
  let result = value + external.length;
  external.push(result);
  return result;
};
console.log(impure(4)); // 7
console.log(impure(4)); // 8
```

**pure function**

```js
const external = [1, 2, 3];
const pure = (value, arr) => {
  let result = value + arr.length;
  return result;
}

console.log(pure(4, external)); // 7
console.log(pure(4, external)); // 7
```

however mutable values can change the result, even with a pure function

```js
const external = [1, 2, 3];
const pure = (value, arr) => {
  let result = value + arr.length;
  return result;
}

console.log(pure(4, external)); // 7
console.log(pure(4, external)); // 7
external.push(4);
console.log(pure(4, external)); // 8
```

**Advantages of pure functions**

- Results are easy to reproduce and test
- Can be called in parallel without altering results
- Allow for memoization
- Potential for lazy evaluation

##Higher order functions

A higher order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or a function that returns a function as a result. And of course, a higher order function could also accept and return a function.

Well known examples of higher order functions are setInterval and setTimeout to control the timing of events:

```js
const logTime = () => console.log(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
const timer = setInterval(logTime, 1000);
setTimeout(() => clearInterval(timer), 3000);
```
example of higher order function:

```js
const attitude = (original, replacement) => source => source.replace(original, replacement);
const snakify = attitude(/millenials/ig, "Snake People");
const hippify = attitude(/baby boomers/ig, "Aging Hippies");

console.log(snakify("The Millenials are always up to something."));
// The Snake People are always up to something.
console.log(hippify("The Baby Boomers just look the other way."));
// The Aging Hippies just look the other way.
```

better readable example:

```js
const attitude = (original, replacement) => {
  return function(source) {
    return source.replace(original, replacement);
  };
};

const snakify = attitude(/millenials/ig, "Snake People");
const hippify = attitude(/baby boomers/ig, "Aging Hippies");

console.log(snakify("The Millenials are always up to something."));
// The Snake People are always up to something.
console.log(hippify("The Baby Boomers just look the other way."));
// The Aging Hippies just look the other way.
```
